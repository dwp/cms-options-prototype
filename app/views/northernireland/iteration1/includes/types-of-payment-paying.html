      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you are under the age of 19, a Northern Ireland resident, or if you have experienced
              domestic abuse – you do not need to pay the fee and this change will not impact you
          </li>
          <li>there will be a financial impact of delaying - your child maintenance payments can only
              be backdated to your application date</li>

<p class="govuk-body">There are 2 ways you can make payments.</p>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You’ll pay child maintenance directly into the other parent’s bank account.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to have any contact with the other parent and there are no additional fees.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you miss Direct Pay payments, we can change your arrangement to Collect and Pay and take enforcement action to get unpaid child maintenance to the other parent.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will collect maintenance from you and pass it to the other parent.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can only start with Collect and Pay if the other parent agrees to it.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Collect and Pay can be enforced if you stop responding to us or stop making payments.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are extra fees for this service, which are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    20% will be added to the amount you need to pay the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
    4% will be taken off the payment the other parent receives
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, if the payment amount was £100, you would pay £120 and the other parent would get £96.</p>
