<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to use the Child Maintenance Service there is a £20 application fee. You will not have to pay this fee if you are under 19 years old or have experienced domestic abuse.</p>

          You can consider that:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you are under the age of 19, a Northern Ireland resident, or if you have experienced
              domestic abuse – you do not need to pay the fee and this change will not impact you
          </li>
          <li>there will be a financial impact of delaying - your child maintenance payments can only
              be backdated to your application date</li>

<p>There are 2 ways you can get payments.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Direct Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The other parent will pay child maintenance directly to your bank account.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You do not need to have any contact with the other parent and there are no additional fees.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If the other parent misses Direct Pay payments, we can change your arrangement to Collect and Pay and take enforcement action to get unpaid child maintenance to you.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Collect and Pay</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will collect maintenance from the other parent and pass it to you.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can only start with Collect and Pay if the other parent:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    refuses to respond to us
  </li>
  <li>
    agrees to use Collect and Pay
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You can change to Collect and Pay later if Direct Pay does not work.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are extra fees for this service, which are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    20% will be added to the amount the other parents needs to pay you 
  </li>
  <li>
    4% will be taken off the payment you receive
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">For example, if the payment amount was £100, you would get £96 and the other parent would pay £120.</p>
