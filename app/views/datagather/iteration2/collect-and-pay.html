              We cannot guarantee that you will be able to pay using Collect and Pay.
              You can only start with a Collect and Pay arrangement if both parents agree to it.

            <p>If the other parent agrees to use Collect and Pay, we will: </p>

              <li>work out how much the payment will be and tell both parents</li>
              <li>collect payments from you and pass them on to the other parent </li>
              <li>review your calculation each year, or if either parent’s circumstances change</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the other parent does not agree to use Collect and Pay,
              your case will be set up using Direct Pay. You can change to Collect and Pay if the Direct Pay arrangement
              does not work.</p>

            <p>Collect and Pay can also be enforced if you miss payments or stop responding to the Child Maintenance
              Service. </p>
