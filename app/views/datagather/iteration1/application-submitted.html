        <p class="govuk-body">
          Once we have reviewed your information, we will send you a text message and a letter to confirm how much child maintenance you
          need to pay and when you need to pay it. <br>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Find out how much you need to pay</h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">
          We cannot confirm how much you will need to pay until we have reviewed your information.
          This usually takes 6 weeks or less. It can take longer if there are disputes about the information we have been given. <br></p>
          
          <p class="govuk-body">
          You can enter your details into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/calculate-child-maintenance" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Child Maintenance Calculator (opens in new tab)</a> to get an estimated payment amount.
          Your actual child maintenance payments may be different to this estimation.
