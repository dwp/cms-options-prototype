            <p class="govuk-body">You can make a private arrangement with your child’s other parent. No one else has to
              be involved. You and the other parent can organise everything yourselves.
            </p>
            <p> For example, you and the other parent can agree:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              {% if data['will-you-be-paying-or-receiving'] === 'paying' %}

              {% include './includes/own-arrangement-generic.html' %}
              {% endif %}
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">Making your own arrangement might be a good option if:</p>

              <li>
                you and the other parent can communicate well

              <li>
                you feel safe dealing with the other parent
