<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service may be able to arrange child maintenance for you. Using the Child Maintenance Service is less flexible than making your own arrangement because the calculation is a fixed amount based on the paying parent’s earnings.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Using the Child Maintenance Service might be a good option if:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    you do not have contact with the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
    you do not feel safe dealing with the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
   you do not think the other parent will stick to an agreement
  </li>
</ul>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    work out how much child maintenance you will pay
  </li>
  <li>
    arrange for the you to pay the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
    take action if you do not make payments
  </li>
  <li>
    enforce or take legal action to recover any missed maintenance payments.
  </li>
  <li>
    help find the other parent if you’ve lost contact
  </li>
  <li>
    recalculate the payment amount if a changes in your circumstances is reported. For example, if your salary changes
  </li>
  <li>
    help if someone says they are not the parent of a child
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It will take about 6 weeks to process an application and to begin processing payments. The receiving parent should allow 10-12 weeks from the application date to receive their first payment. If contact cannot be made with the other parent, the application will take longer.</p>
