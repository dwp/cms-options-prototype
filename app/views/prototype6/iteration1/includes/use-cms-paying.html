<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    work out how much child maintenance you should pay and when you should pay it 
  </li>
  <li>
    take action if payments are not made in full or on time
  </li>
  <li>
    help find the other parent if you have lost contact
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you get child maintenance</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">There are two child maintenance service types:</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Direct pay</strong> - You will pay child maintenance into the other parent's bank or building society. You manage payments using an online account. </p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Collect and Pay</strong> - the Child Maintenance Service will take payment from you and pass it on to the other parent. There are fees for both parents if you use this service. </p> 

<p>You do not have to have any contact with the other parent for either service type.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">To decide your service type, we take into account:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>
both parent's service type preference
</li>
<li>
  your payment history using the Child Maintenance Service (if you have any) 
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long an application takes</h2>
