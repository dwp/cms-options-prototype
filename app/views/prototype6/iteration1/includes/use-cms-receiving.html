<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service may be able to arrange child maintenance for you. Using the Child Maintenance Service is less flexible than making your own arrangement because the calculation is a fixed amount based on the paying parent’s earnings.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Using the Child Maintenance Service might be a good option if you do not have contact with the other parent, you do not think they will stick to an agreement or if you do not feel safe dealing with them.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Payments made to you through the Child Maintenance Service are not taken into account when calculating your other benefit payments. 
</div>

<p class="govuk-body">Using the Child Maintenance Service might be a good option if:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    you do not have contact with the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
    you do not feel safe dealing with the other parent
  </li>
  <li>
   you do not think the other parent will stick to an agreement
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service will:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    work out how much child maintenance you will be paid
  </li>
  <li>
    arrange for the the other parent to pay you
  </li>
  <li>
    take action if payments are not made
  </li>
  <li>
    enforce or take legal action to recover any missed maintenance payments.
  </li>
  <li>
    help find the other parent if you’ve lost contact
  </li>
  <li>
    recalculate the payment amount if changes in parents’ circumstances are reported (for example, if the other parent's salary changes)
  </li>
  <li>
    help if someone says they are not the parent of the child
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It will take about 6 weeks to process an application and to begin processing payments. The receiving parent should allow 10-12 weeks from the application date to receive their first payment. If contact cannot be made with the other parent, the application will take longer.</p>
