<p class="govuk-body">The Child Maintenance Service can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    work out how much child maintenance you should get and when you should get it 
  </li>
  <li>
    take action if payments are not made in full or on time
  </li>
  <li>
    help find the other parent if you have lost contact
  </li>
  <li>
    help if the other parent denies they are the child's biological or legal parent 
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you get child maintenance</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">There are two child maintenance service types:</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Direct pay</strong> - the other parent will pay child maintenance into your bank or building society. You manage payments using an online account. </p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Collect and Pay</strong> - the Child Maintenance Service will take payment from the other parent and pass it on to you. There are fees for both parents if you use this service. </p> 

<p>You do not have to have any contact with the other parent for either service type.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">To decide your service type, we take into account:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>
both parent's service type preference
</li>
<li>
the other parent's payment history
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long an application takes</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">It can take up to 6 weeks to process an application and arrange a payment plan. Complex cases may take longer.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
It will take longer to process if your child is not registered for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit" class="govuk-link">Child Benefit (opens in new tab)</a>.
