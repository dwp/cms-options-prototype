</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How you get child maintenance</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">There are two child maintenance service types:</p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Direct pay</strong> - the other parent will pay child maintenance into your bank or building society. You manage payments using an online account. </p>

<p class="govuk-body"><strong>Collect and Pay</strong> - the Child Maintenance Service will take payment from the other parent and pass it on to you. There are fees for both parents if you use this service. </p>
